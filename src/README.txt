# Instructions

Please make the Bob.java class do the following things

## Bob

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

Bob answers 'Sure' if you ask him a question.

He answers 'Woah, chill out' if you yell at him.

He says 'Fine. Be that way' if you address him without actually saying
anything.

He answers 'Whatever' to anything else.

## Instructions

Run the BobTest.java file as a java application, and fix each of the errors in turn. Note that this short challenge doesnt use or require a testing framework. When all of the tests are passing, submit your Bob.java 

The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make it.

Please make your solution as general as possible. It should work with any input that fits the
specification, and not just the tested parameters.

Have fun!


## Making the Test Pass

Simply run BobTest.java as a java application in eclipse, or compile and run on the command line.
